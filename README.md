## Getting Started

To view this application, simply download and run the executable file inside the `/dist/` directory.

To get started using the devlopment build is just as easy. First we will need to clone the repo, and set up an environment variable for your CoinMarketCap API key. Get yours [here](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/).

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```
CMC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Once completed `cd` inside the project directory and run the following commands.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run electron:serve
```
